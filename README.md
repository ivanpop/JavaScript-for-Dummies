Some assignments from The Telerik Academy on JS Fundamentals

  1.Binary search
    
    The assignment was to put the binary search to some use.

	
	
  2.Convert number to it's English word
  
    3 switch-cases was all that it needs.
  
 
  
  3.Find words in text
  
    The assignment was to find how many times a given word is found in a text and also there has to be a case-sensitive
    and a case-insensitive search.Also there must be function overloading or "fake overloading" since JS doesn't support
    overloading and I did it using a switch case and the functions arguments length.
    
    First I remove all dots and commas with "someText.replace(/\W+/g, ' ');	" and then I make an array of all the words
    in the text with "tempString.split(' ');".After that it's a simple comparing of strings.Case 2 is the case-sensitive
    search and case 3 is the insensitive.



  4.Quadratic equation
